Investment Analysis by CSV file with Data visualization

In this project, I built this comprehensive financial data tracking system that imports investment transaction data from CSV files and analyzes it. The program begins by modifying an existing financial tracker to handle investment-specific data, implementing specialized categorization for stock purchases, sales, dividends, and fees. Then, I addressed Google Sheets API rate limit issues by creating an optimized CSV importer that processes transactions in smaller batches with appropriate delays. Finally,I developed dedicated visualization tools that generate insightful investment charts—including portfolio allocation, stock holdings, cumulative growth, dividend tracking, and fund performance comparisons—without hitting API limits. The resulting system enables effective monitoring and analysis of investment activity while maintaining data integrity and producing professional-quality visual reports.
